Learning Node, Express &amp; MongoDB.

I'm working at BAE as software engineer but none of my work there is accessible publically on GitHub so I have created this project to show off my backend skills.

I graduated from the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) in 2022.

## Running Locally

Since this app is made with Node, Express and MongoDB you'll need to run ```npm i``` after you've cloned or forked the repo onto your local machine.
